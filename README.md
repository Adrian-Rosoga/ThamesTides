# Tides

Started getting interested in Thames flow when in search for the rather rare moment when the river is at [slack water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_water).
To get reflections on the surface of the water not only Thames should be between tides but there should be no winds and no boats.
In a blue moon it happens, as below.

Data is scrapped from the .gov site and enriched with the tide rise speed graph and max and min levels.
